Step 1 Passed
HTML elements have opening tags like "<h1>"" and closing tags like "</h1>".
Find the h1 element and change its text to:
"CatPhotoApp" 
Make sure that the text is between its opening and closing tags.

Step 2 Passed 
The "h1" to "h6" heading elements are used to signify the importance of
content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance,
so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one
h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below
higher importance headings.
Below the "h1" element, add an h2 element with this text:
"Cat Photos"

Step 3 Passed 
The "p" element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. 
Create a "p" element below your "h2" element and give it the following text:
"Click here to view more cat photos" 

Step 4 Passed 
Commenting allows you to leave messages whitout affecting the browser display.
It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with "<  --", 
contains any number of lines of text, and ends whith "-- >".
For example: "< ! -- TODO : Remove h1 -- >"
Contains the text: "TODO : Remove h1"
Add a comment above the "p" element with this text:
"TODO : Add a link to cat photos"

Step 5 Passed 
HTML5 has some elements that identify some different content areas.
These elements make your HTML more easier to read and helps with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 
and accesibility. 
Identify the main section of this page by adding a "< main >" opening tag after the "h1" element
and a "< / main >" closing tag after the "p" element.

Step 6 Passed 
In the previous step, you nested the "h2" element, and "p" element within the "main" element.
A nested element is a child of its parent element. It should be indented two more spaces 
than its parent element to improve readability, like this:
"< ul >
   < li > Child Element 1 < li >
   < li > Child Element 2 < li >
 < / ul >"
Add two spaces in front of the three child elementas of "main"  
so your HTML is more readable. 

Step 7 Passed 
You can add images to your website by using the "img" element. "img" elements have an opening tag 
without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as "a self-closing tag". 
Add an "img" element below the "p" element. At this point no image wil show up in the browser. 

Step 8 Passed 
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior.
the "src" attribute in an "img" element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located). 
An example of an "img" element using "src" attribute: < img src = "https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">.
Inside the existing "img" element, add an "src" attribute with this URL: 
"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg".

Step 9 Passed 
All "img" elements shold have an "alt" attribute. 
The "alt" attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed
if the image fails to load. For example, < img src="cat.jpg" alt"A cat"> has an "alt" attribute with the text "A cat"
Inside the "img" element, add an "alt" attribute with this text: 
"A cute orange cat lying on its back"

Step 10 Passed 
You can link another page with the anchor "a" element. 
For example, "< a href='https//freecodecamp.org'>< a >"
would link to "freecodecamp.org"
Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to
"https://freecatphotoapp.com". At this point, the link won't show up in the preview.

Step 11 Passed 
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tag of an anachor element. 
For example, "< a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org'> click here to go to FreeCodeCamp.org< / a >"
is a link with the text "click here to go to FreeCodeCamp.org".
Add the anchor text "cat photos" to the anchor element. This will become a link's text

Step 12 Passed 
Turn the words "cat photos" located inside "p" element into a link 
using the same value for the href attribute as the link below the "p" element. 
The "p" element should show the same text in the browser, but the words "cat photos" should now be a link. 
Make sure to remove the "a" element with the text "cat photos" on the line below the "p" element.
